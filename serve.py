FitFindr over HTTP. ← UNIT 9

    python serve.py                       run it on your machine
    gunicorn serve:app                    run it the way a host runs it

Everything else in this repo exits after one command. A host has nothing to
keep running, so a command line cannot be deployed. This file is the smallest
thing that can: it starts a web server, waits, and hands each request to the
same `run_agent()` your CLI calls. **No new agent logic lives here.** If your
loop works from `python app.py ask`, it works from here; if it doesn't, fix it
there, not in this file.

Two routes:

    POST /ask       {"query": "vintage graphic tee under $30",
                     "wardrobe": {...}}     ← wardrobe is optional
    GET  /health    is it awake?

`/ask` returns the session dict from `run_agent()` as JSON, unchanged — the
same keys you print from the command line, including `error`. Read
`session["error"]` first, exactly as you do everywhere else.

It runs **one request at a time**, and one route is deliberately slower than a
web server has to be. The reason is worth reading before you deploy: see the
note above `_one_at_a_time` below — it also decides which gunicorn worker you
can use.

⚠️ There is deliberately NO logging, NO timing and NO request counting in this
file. That is unit 9's follow-along: you instrument this yourself, first, and
then deploy it. A structured log you were handed teaches you nothing about
what belongs in one — and the timing field is the one everybody skips.

# ── one request at a time ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Here's why this exists.
#
# A web server will happily run two requests at once. Two things in this repo
# assume otherwise:
#
#   • If you moved a tool onto MCP in unit 4, `mcp_client.call_tool` starts
#     `mcp_server.py` as a separate process over stdio, one per call. Two
#     overlapping requests means two extra Python interpreters, and the free
#     tier you're deploying to has 512 MB for all of it. That is the reason
#     that would still be here even if everything else were perfect.
#   • `generate.py`'s pacing window and its call counter are plain module
#     globals — deliberately, because that file is teaching pacing and quota,
#     not locking. Two threads sharing them means the per-minute limiter is
#     counting something that isn't true.
#
# What the lock covers is exactly the agent run: the part that spawns
# processes and calls the model. Reading the request, rejecting a bad one, and
# turning the answer into JSON all happen outside it — so a request with a
# malformed body comes straight back with a 400 instead of queueing behind
# somebody else's agent.
#
# Serialising the runs costs you nothing here — this is one user asking one
# question — and it keeps the deployed behaviour identical to the CLI's. When
# that stops being an acceptable trade, the fix is a real queue, not a bigger
# lock.
#
# The same constraint decides your start command, and this is the part that
# bites in deployment rather than on your machine. `mcp_client.call_tool`
# wraps `asyncio.run()`, and `asyncio.run()` refuses to start when an event
# loop is already running. An async worker always has one running. So under
# `gunicorn -k gevent` (or `-k eventlet`, or `serve:app` wrapped for an ASGI
# server like uvicorn) EVERY MCP call fails with "asyncio.run() cannot be
# called from a running event loop" — not some of them under load, all of
# them, every time, in a place your laptop never showed you.
#
#     gunicorn serve:app              ← right: the DEFAULT sync worker
#     gunicorn -k gevent serve:app    ← breaks every MCP call you make
